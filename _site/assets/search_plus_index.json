    "body": "The JMT Cognitive Neurophysiology Lab is led by Julio Martinez-Trujillo, MD PhD, and is part of the Robarts Research Institute in Western University. The laboratory has multiple research interests: Neurophysiological bases of attention Attention can be defined as the selective filtering and modulation of information processing in the brain. It plays a major role in human performance. Currently, we know that visual signals entering the different cortical areas are amplified when we are paying attention to them and attenuated when we ignore them. How the brain accomplishes this modulation of sensory information processing remains unclear. [insert what the lab does here] Neural mechanism of working memory Working memory can be defined as the short-term maintenance and manipulation of information that is no longer available to the senses. Working memory is thought to arise from the activity of networks of interconnected neurons that produce sustained firing patterns that encode the contents of working memory in the absence of sensory inputs. [insert what the lab does here] Pathophysiology of Autism Spectrum Disorders Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction, accompanied by restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, that become evident during early development. [insert what the lab does here] Cell types of the primate neocortex The brain contains a variety of neuronal types. Over the last decade it has become clear that neuronal types vary among different species. We use tools such as patch clamp and anatomical reconstruction of neurons in slices of neocortical tissue to characterize the morphology and function of neurons. By building a database of neurons, we aim to produce biophysical circuit models of different brain regions."

    "body": "What is the purpose of an academic poster? “This is basically your paper.” -Julio to Kartik (sometime in November 2022) While running by my poster in prep for SfN 2022, Julio told me this and I wish I knew much earlier. Your poster (if it’s not already published) is preparation for writing your paper. It is a tool to organize your story. An academic poster serves multiple purposes for trainees at different stages: It’s an opportunity to receive feedback on your paradigm, methodology, analysis, and or findings. While we’re deep in the day-to-day of research, it can sometimes be difficult to see the glaring issues that someone else may have. It’s an opportunity to publicize your amazing research! It’s an opportunity to network!! While I was a younger trainee, the feedback was useful. Now that I’m wrapping up my PhD (at the time of writing this), the latter two points are the primary reasons why presenting posters are so important. Depending on how you present your work, you might find new collaborators, people who want to use your paradigm or data analysis, or best of all future employers (either academic or industry). General design principles A poster is a prop - not a paper Be selective of your data Utilize Gestalt principles … Presenting posters Be welcoming Although many conferences only require you to be at your poster for a 1-2 hour window of the entire poster session, do your best to stay for the entirety of it. Stand at the side of your poster. Engage your audience Know your elevator pitch Start a conversation Tell a story Practice … Useful resources http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/poster.design/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1955747/"

    "body": "Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and projections, data visualization provides an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data. In storytelling, this translates to a narrative that is driven by facts and figures, presented in a way that is both comprehensive and engaging. Choosing a visualization type The purpose of data visualization is to emphasize observations that would not otherwise jump out when looking at a list of values to enable people to quickly and easily grasp your data. What is your data trying to communicate? Are you trying to convey differences between the distribution of two groups? Change over time? Correlation between between two variables? A pattern? Individual or group differences? What kind of data do you have? Numerical? Categorical? Continuous? Discrete? Who is the audience? Experts in your field? Outsiders to the field? Lay audience?
