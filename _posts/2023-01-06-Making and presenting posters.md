# What is the purpose of an academic poster?
>"This is basically your paper."\
-Julio to Kartik (sometime in November 2022)

While running by my poster *in prep* for SfN 2022, Julio told me this and I wish I knew much earlier. Your poster (if it's not already published) is preparation for writing your paper. It is a tool to organize your story.

An academic poster serves multiple purposes for trainees at different stages:
1. It's an opportunity to receive feedback on your paradigm, methodology, analysis, and or findings. While we're deep in the day-to-day of research, it can sometimes be difficult to see the glaring issues that someone else may have.
1. It's an opportunity to publicize your amazing research!
1. It's an opportunity to network!!

While I was a younger trainee, the feedback was useful. Now that I'm wrapping up my PhD (at the time of writing this), the latter two points are the primary reasons why presenting posters are so important. Depending on how you present your work, you might find new collaborators, people who want to use your paradigm or data analysis, or best of all future employers (either academic or industry).

# Presenting posters
1. **Be welcoming**

    Although many conferences only require you to be at your poster for a 1-2 hour window of the entire poster session, do your best to stay for the entirety of it.

    Stand at the side of your poster.

1. **Engage your audience**

1. **Know your elevator pitch**

1. **Start a conversation**

1. **Tell a story**

1. **Practice**
